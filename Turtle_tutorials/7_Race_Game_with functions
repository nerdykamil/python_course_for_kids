### Functions
'''
Suppose you are playing a car racing game and you have nitro boost with you that you use to help you 
win the race. Functions are same, they help us do specific tasks in our code.

For example, let's say you're playing a game where you need to roll a dice and find out what number
you got. You could create a function called "roll_dice()" that simulates rolling a dice.
Whenever you want to roll the dice, you just say "roll_dice()" and the function gives you a
random number
'''


import turtle
import random

## make players

player_one = turtle.Turtle()
player_one.color("green")
player_one.shape("turtle")
player_one.penup()
player_one.goto(-200,100)
player_two = player_one.clone()
player_two.color("blue")
player_two.penup()
player_two.goto(-200,-100)

## make final points

player_one.goto(300,60)
player_one.pendown()
player_one.circle(40)
player_one.penup()
player_one.goto(-200,100)
player_two.goto(300,-140)
player_two.pendown()
player_two.circle(40)
player_two.penup()
player_two.goto(-200,-100)

## function to choose randomly from die to select number of steps to take
